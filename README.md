Project Title: JFCoop Membership Management System
Project Overview

The JFCoop Membership Management System is a SQL-based database created for a fictional cooperative society, JFCoop. The database stores and manages data related to members, transactions, loans, and cooperative activities. This system demonstrates proficiency in designing, managing, and querying relational databases.
Project Goals

    To design a database structure that efficiently stores and manages cooperative data.
    To demonstrate SQL skills in data modeling, query writing, and database management.
    To provide example SQL queries and operations that might be used in a real-world cooperative database.
    Database Design

The project includes 10 main tables to represent different areas of cooperative management:

    Members (JFCoopMembersTable) - Stores member profiles, including personal and contact information.
    Loans (JFMemberLoans) - Records loan information, including loan type, amount, interest rate, and repayment status.
    Transactions (JFCoopTransactions) - Manages member transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
    Savings (JFCoopMemberSavings) - Details about each memberâ€™s savings accounts.
    Payments (dbo.Payments) - Tracks payment records for loans and dues.
    Products (JFCoopProducts) - Catalog of products available for purchase by members.
    Inventory (Inventory) - Manages stock levels of products within the cooperative.
    Employee (dbo.JFCoopEmployee) - Stores employee details and roles within the cooperative.
    Feedback (dbo.Feedback) - Stores member feedback on products and services.
